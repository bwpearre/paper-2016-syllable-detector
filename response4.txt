Dear PLOS,

I've made the requested changes.

1. Yes, that looks correct.

2. A related item requested by the formatting guide you sent is the removal of the funding sources from my Acknowledgments. I did this. Ok? I'll make sure that it's all in the Financial Disclosure.

3. Done.

4. Please make sure I've done that correctly. Elsewhere you'd said that you don't allow subsubsections, so I'd been using labeled "paragraphs" instead. But here, 3 levels means sections, subsections, and subsubsections, so I've reverted to that. Good?

5. Done.

6. I believe that the seven figures are now all compliant.

Thank you!
-Ben

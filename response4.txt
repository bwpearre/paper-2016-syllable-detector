Dear PLOS,

I've made the requested changes.

1. Yes, looks good.

2. As requested by the formatting guide you sent, I've removed the funding sources from Acknowledgments. I'll make sure that it's in the Financial Disclosure.

3. Done.

4. Please make sure I've done that correctly. Elsewhere you'd said that you don't allow subsubsections, so I'd been using labeled "paragraphs" instead. But here, 3 levels means sections, subsections, and subsubsections, so I've reverted to that. Good?

5. Done.

6. I believe that the seven figures are now all compliant.

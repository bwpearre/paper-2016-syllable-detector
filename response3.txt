Dear Dr. Cooper,

Thank you again! In answer to your comments:

> 1.  Line 32:  Please correct typo:  "Desired data" is what I believe you mean here

I see what you mean, but I am also listing desirable traits (assuming that it is inferred that Accuracy, Latency, Jitter, etc should be good). I'd prefer to leave it as is.

> 2.  Line 99:  "Learning a detector"  Do you mean training a detector?

I have made that change. Thanks!

> 3.  Figure 3, please adjust the y axis label on the graph so that it does not overlap with the scale labels.

Done. Thank you! I should have noticed that.

> Last, I tried to locate the files using the DOI, and was unable to do so.  This may reflect my ignorance, as I was able to find all of the files and software with the http links.  I believe that this is suitable for the PLOS data availability policy.  Please confirm the DOIs prior to submitting your revised manuscript.  This is nice work, I look forward to seeing this used in the field.

How did you try to locate them by DOI? Google doesn't seem to have indexed them yet, but asking http://doi.org for them (either from their main page's search box or prepending "doi.org/<doi>" produced the correct pages for me. If you'd like, I can add a "http://doi.org/" prefix to each DOI, but I most often see just the DOIs listed rather than URLs.

This time, I've created a difference document from the last submission you saw, with only the above changes. That scarcely seems useful--the only changes are your 2 and 3, and the latter doesn't get tagged by my difference finder--but it was easy.

Many thanks!

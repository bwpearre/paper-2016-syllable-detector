Dear editors,

The paper introduces and evaluates a piece of software that is of
general interest to a small but growing audience: neuroscientists
working in the zebra finch, and possibly other bird species.  It
allows precisely timed triggering of other experimental apparatus in
response to syllables during bird song.  Since such a method
facilitates a wide variety of experiments in this species, many labs
have developed functionally similar software, but few have released
details on how they did it, and those few who reported on accuracy
have not done so very thoroughly.

We've gone to some lengths to describe the software and characterise
its performance in detail.  Based on the descriptions available from
other labs, our software advances the state of the art in terms of
accuracy, precision, speed, ease of use, availability, and cost.

I'd submitted this paper to PLOS CompBio, and asked to have it treated
as a Software or Methods paper.  They suggested that I resubmit to
PLOS ONE.  We believe we've addressed the reviewers' concerns, and
would like to offer the revised manuscript for your consideration.

If accepted, before final submission, all code will be placed under an
appropriate open source license, final release versions generated, and
DOIs created as described in
https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/ .  The relevant
example/testing datasets will be uploaded to one of your approved
repositories.  For now, in lieu of final release DOIs, we provide
links to our development repositories.  If you would like anything
else, such as access to the datasets for review, please contact me.

The Academic Editor on your staff who would probably find this paper
most interesting is Johan J Bolhuis.

Thank you!
